Bitvest - Community-powered Bitcoin business platform

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thorie7912/bitvest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thorie7912/bitvest)

TL;DR: A platform for contributor-owned businesses (people like you!) to earn Bitcoin, invest Bitcoin, and gain Bitcoin equity.

## Summary

Kickstarter is cool, but you know what would be really cool? If you could invest not only money but time and skills, as then share in the profitable success of the project by owning a piece of it!

Imagine if you could contribute your design skills, coding skills, or marketing skills to a business idea in your spare time. Just a few hours to earn a few shares in a business. And the business takes off! It's like working for a startup without all the pain and suffering of getting hired, commuting everyday, and other nonsense.

Traditional models of business make it difficult to do this because of an incomprehensible pile of red tape, paperwork, and procedures that must be filed to start a business, maintain it, and hire employees. Bitcoin makes it easy to ignore all of that nonsense, and Bitvest is the platform that will power this movement.

Bitvest lets you choose which projects to contribute to, and what amount of time you can spare. There are no commitments, other than to specific tasks (or bounties) you've selected for yourself.

Anyone can start a Bitvest business with a click of a button. The platform handles distribution of ownership (shares) based on the tasks completed. The more you contribute, the more you will own in the success of the business.

Decisions of the business is based on shareholder majority. That way, businesses are truly owned and operated by the contributors.

## Getting Started

First, create an account. Then you can either browse through existing businesses, or start a new one. Keep in mind, every business is community-owned. People who contribute are the ones who can decide how the business operates.

### Selecting a Task

If you find a business that you're interested in contributing to, and have the skills to do so, simply assign the task to yourself. You'll see the details of how you will get paid upon approval of the results. It may be direct Bitcoin payout, equity share payout, or a mixture of both.

### Completing a Task and Getting Paid

Once you've completed a task, you will now earn Bitcoin (which you can send to your Bitcoin wallet) or you may have ownership of some shares. These shares are counted when the business makes profit forever, as long as the business is operational. You'll earn a percentage share of the profit every time.

### Investing

If you prefer to invest into a business directly (and it is accepting it), you can deposit some amount into it which will give you some shares in return.
